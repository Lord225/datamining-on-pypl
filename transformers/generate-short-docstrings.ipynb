This works for Scipy\\'s metrics, but is less\\n    efficient than passing the metric name as a string.\\n\\n    Distance matrices are not supported.\\n\\n    Valid values for metric are:\\n\\n    - from scikit-learn: [\\'cityblock\\', \\'cosine\\', \\'euclidean\\', \\'l1\\', \\'l2\\',\\n      \\'manhattan\\']\\n\\n    - from scipy.spatial.distance: [\\'braycurtis\\', \\'canberra\\', \\'chebyshev\\',\\n      \\'correlation\\', \\'dice\\', \\'hamming\\', \\'jaccard\\', \\'kulsinski\\',\\n      \\'mahalanobis\\', \\'minkowski\\', \\'rogerstanimoto\\', \\'russellrao\\',\\n      \\'seuclidean\\', \\'sokalmichener\\', \\'sokalsneath\\', \\'sqeuclidean\\',\\n      \\'yule\\']\\n\\n    See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these\\n    metrics.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n       `\\'kulsinski\\'` is deprecated from SciPy 1.9 and will be removed in SciPy 1.11.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n       `\\'matching\\'` has been removed in SciPy 1.9 (use `\\'hamming\\'` instead).\\n\\nmetric_kwargs : dict, default=None\\n    Keyword arguments to pass to specified metric function.\\n\\nReturns\\n-------\\nargmin : numpy.ndarray\\n    Y[argmin[i], :] is the row in Y that is closest to X[i, :].\\n\\nSee Also\\n--------\\npairwise_distances : Distances between every pair of samples of X and Y.\\npairwise_distances_argmin_min : Same as `pairwise_distances_argmin` but also\\n    returns the distances.\\n\\nExamples\\n--------\\n>>> from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import pairwise_distances_argmin\\n>>> X = [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]\\n>>> Y = [[1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\\n>>> pairwise_distances_argmin(X, Y)\\narray([0, 1])',\n",

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.\\n:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed\\n:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.\\n:param int grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer.

Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.\\n:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.\\n:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.

The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set.

Otherwise, the non-commutative\\nentities are retained and the calling routine should handle\\nreplacements in this case since some care must be taken to keep\\ntrack of the ordering of symbols when they occur within Muls.\\n\\nParameters\\n==========\\n\\nname : str\\n    ``name``, if given, is the name that will be used with numbered Dummy\\n    variables that will replace the non-commutative objects and is mainly\\n    used for doctesting purposes.\\n\\nExamples\\n========\\n\\n>>> from sympy.physics.secondquant import Commutator, NO, F, Fd\\n>>> from sympy import symbols\\n>>> from sympy.core.exprtools import _mask_nc\\n>>> from sympy.abc import x, y\\n>>> A, B, C = symbols('A,B,C', commutative=False)\\n\\nOne nc-symbol:\\n\\n>>> _mask_nc(A**2 - x**2, 'd')\\n(_d0**2 - x**2, {_d0: A}, [])\\n\\nMultiple nc-symbols:\\n\\n>>> _mask_nc(A**2 - B**2, 'd')\\n(A**2 - B**2, {}, [A, B])\\n\\nAn nc-object with nc-symbols but no others outside of it:\\n\\n>>> _mask_nc(1 + x*Commutator(A, B), 'd')\\n(_d0*x + 1, {_d0: Commutator(A, B)}, [])\\n>>> _mask_nc(NO(Fd(x)*F(y)), 'd')\\n(_d0, {_d0: NO(CreateFermion(x)*AnnihilateFermion(y))}, [])\\n\\nMultiple nc-objects:\\n\\n>>> eq = x*Commutator(A, B) + x*Commutator(A, C)*Commutator(A, B)\\n>>> _mask_nc(eq, 'd')\\n(x*_d0 + x*_d1*_d0, {_d0: Commutator(A, B), _d1: Commutator(A, C)}, [_d0, _d1])\\n\\nMultiple nc-objects and nc-symbols:\\n\\n>>> eq = A*Commutator(A, B) + B*Commutator(A, C)\\n>>> _mask_nc(eq, 'd')\\n(A*_d0 + B*_d1, {_d0: Commutator(A, B), _d1: Commutator(A, C)}, [_d0, _d1, A, B])\",\n",

The initial guess, `x0`, is reasonably close to `f` \\'s global\\n   minimizing point, `xopt`.\\n\\nParameters `c1` and `c2` must satisfy ``0 < c1 < c2 < 1``.\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n..

If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".

Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests.

       " 'summarize to docstring: The usage is simple: you just pass the match method the current\\npath info as well as the method (which defaults to `GET`).  The\\nfollowing things can then happen:\\n\\n- you receive a `NotFound` exception that indicates that no URL is\\n  matching.  A `NotFound` exception is also a WSGI application you\\n  can call to get a default page not found page (happens to be the\\n  same object as `werkzeug.exceptions.NotFound`)\\n\\n- you receive a `MethodNotAllowed` exception that indicates that there\\n  is a match for this URL but not for the current request method.\\n  This is useful for RESTful applications.\\n\\n- you receive a `RequestRedirect` exception with a `new_url`\\n  attribute.  This exception is used to notify you about a request\\n  Werkzeug requests from your WSGI application.  This is for example the\\n  case if you request ``/foo`` although the correct URL is ``/foo/``\\n  You can use the `RequestRedirect` instance as response-like object\\n  similar to all other subclasses of `HTTPException`.\\n\\n- you receive a ``WebsocketMismatch`` exception if the only\\n  match is a WebSocket rule but the bind is an HTTP request, or\\n  if the match is an HTTP rule but the bind is a WebSocket\\n  request.\\n\\n- you get a tuple in the form ``(endpoint, arguments)`` if there is\\n  a match (unless `return_rule` is True, in which case you get a tuple\\n  in the form ``(rule, arguments)``)\\n\\nIf the path info is not passed to the match method the default path\\ninfo of the map is used (defaults to the root URL if not defined\\nexplicitly).\\n\\nAll of the exceptions raised are subclasses of `HTTPException` so they\\ncan be used as WSGI responses.

Usually ``sqrt(eps)`` is about\\n    1.5e-8.\\nmaxiter : int, optional\\n    Maximum number of iterations to perform. Default is ``200 * len(x0)``.\\nfull_output : bool, optional\\n    If True, return `fopt`, `func_calls`, `grad_calls`, and `warnflag` in\\n    addition to `xopt`.  See the Returns section below for additional\\n    information on optional return values.\\ndisp : bool, optional\\n    If True, return a convergence message, followed by `xopt`.\\nretall : bool, optional\\n    If True, add to the returned values the results of each iteration.\\ncallback : callable, optional\\n    An optional user-supplied function, called after each iteration.\\n    Called as ``callback(xk)``, where ``xk`` is the current value of `x0`.\\nc1 : float, default: 1e-4\\n    Parameter for Armijo condition rule.\\nc2 : float, default: 0.4\\n    Parameter for curvature condition rule.\\n\\nReturns\\n-------\\nxopt : ndarray\\n    Parameters which minimize f, i.e., ``f(xopt) == fopt``.\\nfopt : float, optional\\n    Minimum value found, f(xopt). Only returned if `full_output` is True.\\nfunc_calls : int, optional\\n    The number of function_calls made. Only returned if `full_output`\\n    is True.\\ngrad_calls : int, optional\\n    The number of gradient calls made.

May indicate\\n        that precision was lost, i.e., the routine did not converge.\\n\\n    3 : NaN result encountered.\\n\\nallvecs : list of ndarray, optional\\n    List of arrays, containing the results at each iteration.\\n    Only returned if `retall` is True.\\n\\nSee Also\\n--------\\nminimize : common interface to all `scipy.optimize` algorithms for\\n           unconstrained and constrained minimization of multivariate\\n           functions. It provides an alternative way to call\\n           ``fmin_cg``, by specifying ``method=\\'CG\\'``.\\n\\nNotes\\n-----\\nThis conjugate gradient algorithm is based on that of Polak and Ribiere\\n[1]_.\\n\\nConjugate gradient methods tend to work better when:\\n\\n1. `f` has a unique global minimizing point, and no local minima or\\n   other stationary points,\\n2. `f` is, at least locally, reasonably well approximated by a\\n   quadratic function of the variables,\\n3. `f` is continuous and has a continuous gradient,\\n4. `fprime` is not too large, e.g., has a norm less than 1000,\\n5. The initial guess, `x0`, is reasonably close to `f` \\'s global\\n   minimizing point, `xopt`.\\n\\nParameters `c1` and `c2` must satisfy ``0 < c1 < c2 < 1``.\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n..

Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server\\'s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.\\n:param str _continue: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.\\n:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.\\n:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.\\n:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.\\n:param str pretty: If \\'true\\', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to \\'false\\' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).\\n:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset\\n:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.\\n:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call.

Defaults to \\'false\\' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).\\n:param str _continue: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.\\n:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed\\n:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.\\n:param int grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.\\n:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.\\n:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.\\n:param bool orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7.

Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \\'Orphan\\' - orphan the dependents; \\'Background\\' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \\'Foreground\\' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.\\n:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from.

To learn which resources support\\n    conditions in their IAM policies, see the `IAM\\n    documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies>`__.\\n\\n    **JSON example:**\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n           {\\n             \"bindings\": [\\n               {\\n                 \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\",\\n                 \"members\": [\\n                   \"user:mike@example.com\",\\n                   \"group:admins@example.com\",\\n                   \"domain:google.com\",\\n                   \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\"\\n                 ]\\n               },\\n               {\\n                 \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\",\\n                 \"members\": [\\n                   \"user:eve@example.com\"\\n                 ],\\n                 \"condition\": {\\n                   \"title\": \"expirable access\",\\n                   \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\",\\n                   \"expression\": \"request.time <\\n                   timestamp(\\'2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\\')\",\\n                 }\\n               }\\n             ],\\n             \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\",\\n             \"version\": 3\\n           }\\n\\n    **YAML example:**\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n           bindings:\\n           - members:\\n             - user:mike@example.com\\n             - group:admins@example.com\\n             - domain:google.com\\n             - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\\n             role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\\n           - members:\\n             - user:eve@example.com\\n             role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\\n             condition:\\n               title: expirable access\\n               description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020\\n               expression: request.time < timestamp(\\'2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\\')\\n           etag: BwWWja0YfJA=\\n           version: 3\\n\\n    For a description of IAM and its features, see the `IAM\\n    documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/>`__.',\n",

Only update method 0 proposed by KNV has\\nbeen implemented here, hence the name ``\\'KNV0\\'``.\\n\\nKNV extended to complex poles is used in Matlab\\'s ``place`` function, YT is\\ndistributed under a non-free licence by Slicot under the name ``robpole``.\\nIt is unclear and undocumented how KNV0 has been extended to complex poles\\n(Tits and Yang claim on page 14 of their paper that their method can not be\\nused to extend KNV to complex poles), therefore only YT supports them in\\nthis implementation.\\n\\nAs the solution to the problem of pole placement is not unique for MIMO\\nsystems, both methods start with a tentative transfer matrix which is\\naltered in various way to increase its determinant.  Both methods have been\\nproven to converge to a stable solution, however depending on the way the\\ninitial transfer matrix is chosen they will converge to different\\nsolutions and therefore there is absolutely no guarantee that using\\n``\\'KNV0\\'`` will yield results similar to Matlab\\'s or any other\\nimplementation of these algorithms.\\n\\nUsing the default method ``\\'YT\\'`` should be fine in most cases; ``\\'KNV0\\'``\\nis only provided because it is needed by ``\\'YT\\'`` in some specific cases.\\nFurthermore ``\\'YT\\'`` gives on average more robust results than ``\\'KNV0\\'``\\nwhen ``abs(det(X))`` is used as a robustness indicator.\\n\\n[2]_ is available as a technical report on the following URL:\\nhttps://hdl.handle.net/1903/5598\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n..

You can remove the self-loops and\\nparallel edges (see below) which will likely result in a graph\\nthat doesn\\'t have the exact degree sequence specified.\\n\\nThe density of self-loops and parallel edges tends to decrease as\\nthe number of nodes increases. However, typically the number of\\nself-loops will approach a Poisson distribution with a nonzero mean,\\nand similarly for the number of parallel edges.  Consider a node\\nwith *k* stubs. The probability of being joined to another stub of\\nthe same node is basically (*k* - *1*) / *N*, where *k* is the\\ndegree and *N* is the number of nodes. So the probability of a\\nself-loop scales like *c* / *N* for some constant *c*. As *N* grows,\\nthis means we expect *c* self-loops. Similarly for parallel edges.\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n..

Partition\\nthe interval [0..n-1] into p equal parts, each of length p^(i-1):\\n[0..p^(i-1)-1], [p^(i-1)..2*p^(i-1)-1]...[(p-1)*p^(i-1)..p^i-1].\\nFind a p-Sylow subgroup of Sym(p^(i-1)) (treated as a subgroup\\nof ``self``) acting on each of the parts. Call the subgroups\\nP_1, P_2...P_p. The generators for the subgroups P_2...P_p\\ncan be obtained from those of P_1 by applying a \"shifting\"\\npermutation to them, that is, a permutation mapping [0..p^(i-1)-1]\\nto the second part (the other parts are obtained by using the shift\\nmultiple times). The union of this permutation and the generators\\nof P_1 is a p-Sylow subgroup of ``self``.\\n\\nFor n not equal to a power of p, partition\\n[0..n-1] in accordance with how n would be written in base p.\\nE.g. for p=2 and n=11, 11 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 1 so the partition\\nis [[0..7], [8..9], {10}]. To generate a p-Sylow subgroup,\\ntake the union of the generators for each of the parts.\\nFor the above example, {(0 1), (0 2)(1 3), (0 4), (1 5)(2 7)}\\nfrom the first part, {(8 9)} from the second part and\\nnothing from the third. This gives 4 generators in total, and\\nthe subgroup they generate is p-Sylow.\\n\\nAlternating groups are treated the same except when p=2. In this\\ncase, (0 1)(s s+1) should be added for an appropriate s (the start\\nof a part) for each part in the partitions.\\n\\nSee Also\\n========\\n\\nsylow_subgroup, is_alt_sym',\n",

Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.\\n:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed\\n:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.\\n:param int grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.\\n:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.\\n:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.\\n:param bool orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \"orphan\" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\\'s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.\\n:param str propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \\'Orphan\\' - orphan the dependents; \\'Background\\' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \\'Foreground\\' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.\\n:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset\\n:param str resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset\\n:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.\\n:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.\\n:param V1DeleteOptions body:\\n:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will\\n                         be returned without reading/decoding response\\n                         data.

Defaults to \\'false\\' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).\\n:param str _continue: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.\\n:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed\\n:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.\\n:param int grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.\\n:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.\\n:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.\\n:param bool orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \"orphan\" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\\'s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.\\n:param str propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \\'Orphan\\' - orphan the dependents; \\'Background\\' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \\'Foreground\\' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.\\n:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset\\n:param str resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset\\n:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.\\n:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.\\n:param V1DeleteOptions body:\\n:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will\\n                         be returned without reading/decoding response\\n                         data.
